# Project tests

Purpose: verify contracts and application integration in separate test targets. Design goals: one source tree and explicit test dependencies.

❌ Test success alone does not establish physical-device acceptance.

✅ All model tests live under this root. Qwen35Tests contains model-only checks; AgentModelEvaluationTests contains application prompt experiments. No tests live inside MobileHarness/ModelKit.

✅ ModelKitDefaultsTests checks internal production assembly independently of App; model factory and capability-mapping contract tests remain isolated from business Agents.
