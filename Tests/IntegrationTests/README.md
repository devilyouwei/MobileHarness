# IntegrationTests

Purpose: verify composed Agent, Gateway, Action, Tool, Storage and voice contracts with injected model/device substitutes. Design goals: exercise real boundaries and failure paths without presenting a simulator or test double as physical-device acceptance.

## Current coverage

- ✅ `FunctionTokenParserTests` covers fragmented UTF-8, escaped text, nested Channels, malformed and oversized input, Action resolution and native Tool syntax.
- ✅ `AgentConfigurationTests` covers packaged JSON v4 declarations, metadata, examples, capability visibility, path/Channel validation and malformed or missing configuration. Production permission lists remain in Agent JSON.
- ✅ `ActionExecutionTests` and `RuntimeTests` cover Channel ordering, resource exclusion, bounded admission, cancellation, failure isolation and completion barriers.
- ✅ `CommunicationTests` covers static and directed routing, schema/source checks, admission deadlines, state replacement and independent session cleanup.
- ✅ `VoiceTests`, `SentenceFunctionTests`, `SpeechPlaybackTests`, `PCMResamplerTests` and `StorageTests` cover VAD/ASR observations, captions, Assistant output segmentation, synthesis requests, audio-ID playback, starvation/timeout, resampling, cache leases and expiration. `FixedTextChat` and `SpeechRequestProbe` are test fixtures only.
- ✅ `PhotographyPipelineTests` and `CameraSamplingTests` cover frame sampling/filtering, shared pose inference, current VisionPerception publication and completion-only `UI.showPose` Tool delivery with zero or multiple subscribers. The photography test filename reflects an earlier design; no Photographer Agent is packaged.
- ✅ `EyeTrackingTests` covers pose-derived eye movement and related presentation Actions with injected services.
- ✅ `AssistantChatTests` verifies chat request context, history, expression metadata, hidden capability visibility, malformed output recovery and later-turn continuity.

## Acceptance still required

- ❌ Real microphone/camera behavior, model accuracy, playback and expression appearance, hardware latency, thermal stability and sustained conversation require physical-device testing. Passing this suite establishes protocol behavior with controlled inputs only.

Update this README when test responsibilities change; dated run results belong in [validation history](../../docs/Validation-History.md).

✅ Local document tests cover reopen, cached reads, explicit refresh/invalidation, stale and concurrent writers, size bounds and corrupt-file cache preservation. ❌ Keychain migration requires device acceptance.

✅ FunctionTokenParserTests also covers GenerationTrace: exact raw/fragment preservation, equivalent production parsing and Channel resolution, continuing collection after parser failure, incomplete markup at finish and explicit byte/fragment overflow without eviction.


✅ Structured wait coverage includes byte-fragmentation invariance, lexical nesting/cross-close errors, empty and consecutive groups, reserved aliases, group/depth limits, ordered Assistant speech conversion, entry/exit joins, streaming nested execution, dormant-capacity accounting, task Action limits, module exclusion, independent-task progress and cancellation cleanup. Gates and handler signals verify execution dependencies without timing-based assertions. ❌ Live model syntax compliance and physical timing require device acceptance.

✅ Prompt regression verifies English production guidance, visible Action details grouped by default Channel, stable audio-Channel guidance independent of mapping order, hidden-call/text-effect/Tool exclusion and explicit invalid-mapping failures. ❌ These checks do not measure live-model instruction following.

✅ ConversationHistoryTests covers durable raw/request restoration, interrupted generation, exact ten-round context, failed-round exclusion, atomic archive/reset, raw overflow preservation, parser-failure recording, cancellation and isolated title generation. Assistant request tests now expect history across voice sessions. ❌ These fixtures do not establish real-provider title quality or device performance.

✅ JSON v5 uses Channel-grouped callable Actions; Assistant text interpretation uses Assistant.mapText rather than JSON aliases. Regression coverage checks internal permissions cannot be called through model markup and preserves wait event order. ❌ Live-model/device acceptance is separate from automated checks.

✅ Chat output-token budgets are optional and default to nil. Assistant/cloud requests omit max_tokens so the provider chooses its default; local Qwen uses remaining room in its existing 4096-token context. History shows 模型默认 for omitted values and preserves older explicit budgets. The separate 2000-byte whole-reply cap is removed; parser, queue, timeout and per-segment bounds remain. Explicit title/warmup budgets are unchanged. ❌ Live-provider/device acceptance remains separate.

✅ Runtime tests import the unified Actions and Tools targets. AgentCore is compiled from Agents/Core; test files remain under root Tests. Existing scheduler, conversation, perception and cancellation regressions verify the unchanged chain. ❌ Directory migration alone does not establish device timing.

## Action runtime stage 1

✅ ActionContractTests covers duplicate/invalid/oversized definitions, model/internal startup coverage, non-Action rejection, typed decoding, unknown-key rejection before UI effects, finite lane ownership versus state acceptance, fresh admission IDs, diagnostic overflow without losing Actions, failure propagation and cancellation after commit versus queued cancellation. Synchronization uses bounded single-waiter gates and explicit acknowledgments; no physical timing is inferred. ActionTestRegistry supplies explicit finite-operation metadata for pre-existing scheduler fixtures. Existing integration tests migrated to consistent invocation construction and Gateway-owned scheduling errors.

❌ These fixtures do not establish hardware completion, persistent activity ownership or resource takeover.

## Action runtime stage 2

✅ ActionLifecycleTests covers message-only retry, reserved feedback capacity, owner reincarnation, activity completion, atomic group takeover, stale leases, cleanup timeout/recovery, automatic expiry, protected Tools and owner/session cleanup. All device acknowledgments are controlled test doubles. ❌ These tests do not establish physical device safety.

## Domain-owned behavior assembly

✅ BehaviorAssemblyTests verifies complete production capability coverage, invalid arguments before effects, returning/completion Tool semantics, duplicate/invalid/bounded module catalogs, missing internal Tools and extension modules that execute without an App host. ❌ Hardware acceptance remains separate.

## Action implementation audit

✅ ActionAuthoringTests verifies Speech entry validation and cancellation/error semantics. Existing speech tests use a test-only service convenience that enters through SpeechActions.speak before invoking typed playback.

## Storage domain organization

✅ ConversationHistoryTests imports StorageChat for journal behavior and Storage for durable document fixtures. Core StorageTests remains independent of chat and audio domains.

❌ Image/video/semantic-memory stores remain planned; this migration adds no storage behavior.
