# Language capabilities

Purpose: Group language-generation and judgment protocols with concrete model adapters.

Design goals: explicit ownership, capability boundaries and no duplicate production sources.

- ✅ LLM text chat and JEV judgment contracts; Gemma4 is the current chat adapter.
- ❌ Vision, embedding and a concrete judgment provider.


## Bounded native result continuation

✅ Implemented: Assistant correlates model-native calls with runtime-only feedback under the original turn, awaits complete results and requests the next model round. Limits: four total model rounds,16 native calls,64 KiB aggregate feedback/transcript and one30-second joined generation worker. A failed call becomes data for the model, never an automatic function retry. Cancellation clears owned feedback state and joins model cleanup; unknown/stale/duplicate feedback cannot resume a turn. Internal UI receipts and explicit /status retain their existing handling.

✅ Implemented: ModelKit ChatMessage gains provider-neutral assistant tool-call declarations and tool-result messages. OpenAI serializes request-local aliases consistently across declarations and prior calls; Gemma rejects native transcripts explicitly. Storage keeps optional exact continuation request JSON bytes as data, with bounded records and unchanged v1 compatibility. Camera native model calls use returning protocol registration so actual completion/error can continue reasoning. No change to camera or NexArm function implementation.
